         //Create 3 classes

        //Create the carDriver method. With this method, increase the km of the car with the given value and print a text to the console.
        //All classes should have constructors and all or some of the variables should be defined in constructors.
        //Determine the selling price of the car by creating a method called salesPrice.
        //Create 2 different vehicles in the main class, drive these vehicles and update their prices.
